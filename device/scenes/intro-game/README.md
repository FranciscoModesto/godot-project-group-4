Peril in Daïza Point and Click Game
==============

[Peril in Daïza Point and Click Game](http://perilendaiza.com/) video game started its development during a booksprint organized by the [french-speaking branch of Floss Manuals](http://fr.flossmanuals.net/) between the 22th and 26th of August 2016 in Rennes, France, with the objective of writing a manual for [Creating Point and Click Games with Escoria](https://fr.flossmanuals.net/creating-point-and-click-games-with-escoria/). It's based on the original Peril in Daïza game, created during a previous booksprint.
This game was created and produced by the team of authors with two purposes : to be used as a base for the manual's screenshots and to show that it's actually possible to quickly create a game using Escoria. 
Since then, the project goes on its own path and is developped by the same team.

The project has also its own website [perilendaiza.com](http://perilendaiza.com/).
